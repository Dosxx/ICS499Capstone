            <br />System Overview <br />
            <p>
              File cabinets, desk drawers, refrigerators, pockets through the washing machine, <br />vehicle dashboard; we all have a place 		(or two or three) where we stick important <br />documents for future reference. They pile up, create extra work to find the
              <br /> information we need and cull the things we don&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll just take a picture of it,&rdquo; <br />the       tech savvy among us say. Fast forward a month, and you&rsquo;re scrolling through your <br />camera roll, trying desperately       to find that important document amongst the hundreds <br />of pictures of your pets, children, and meme screenshots.                   Thinking, there must be an <br />easier way to organize all of this.
