Thrown Exceptions: Digital File Cabinet ICS 499 – Capstone 
System Overview 
File cabinets, desk drawers, refrigerators, pockets through the washing machine, 
vehicle dashboard; we all have a place (or two or three) where we stick important 
documents for future reference. They pile up, create extra work to find the 
information we need and cull the things we don’t. “Well, I’ll just take a picture of it,” 
the tech savvy among us say. Fast forward a month, and you’re scrolling through your 
camera roll, trying desperately to find that important document amongst the hundreds 
of pictures of your pets, children, and meme screenshots. Thinking, there must be an 
easier way to organize all of this. Enter the “Digital File Cabinet”. The Digital File 
Cabinet provides a one-stop shop for digitizing and organizing the paper documents 
cluttering up your home and office. It utilizes your device’s camera to save copies 
of your documents to a neatly organized, customizable encrypted file management system. 
You worry, “what if I lose my device?”, Digital File Cabinet is backed up on the cloud
so you can responsibly dispose of all that extra paper clutter and access your documents
from any compatible device.
